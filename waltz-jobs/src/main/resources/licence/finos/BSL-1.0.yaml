    compliance_notes: For distributions “of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor” (i.e., UB and MB use cases), these requirements need not be met. However, you might consider the need to identify the presence of software under BSL-1.0 for other reasons, especially if you have an agreement that wraps around this code/license.
