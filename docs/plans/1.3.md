# Waltz 1.3 and beyond



## Executive Summary

The next release of Waltz (1.3 est. end April 2017) will focus on the following 
main topics:
- Flow management: metadata and datatype taxonomies
- Survey enhancements: simple survey builder and enhanced integration
- Perspective visualisation
- Inter-measurable relationships

Before outlining the plan in more detail let us recap what was delivered in the 1.2 
release.


## Recap of 1.2

The release of 1.2 (on 27th Feb 2017) introduced 3 new features:

 - Measurables: ability to associate/rate applications against multiple taxonomies.
 - Perspectives (phase 1): extends the associations between applications and measurables 
by introducing a second measurable.  This allows for a more nuanced view of an 
application.
 - Surveys (phase 1): This was brought forward in the plan and surveys can now be issued
 against applications and change initiatives using app-groups as a driving selector.

__Deferred__ 

 - Inter-Measurable relationships: to some extent this is mitigated by the 'related-points'
 - Aggregate perspective views: currently we can only visualize perspectives at an
application level, we need to support viewing at measurable level.  Key challenge is 
how to deal with large amounts of associated applications.


## Flow Management

Currently Waltz supports viewing interactions between applications through `Logical Flows`
and through `Physical Flows`.
  
_Physical Flow data types_
  
We currently allow data types to be associated to logical flows but not physical flows. 
This modification will extend the physical flow information to include data types. 
Data types between logical and physical flows will be synchronised to ensure they 
remain consistent.

_Physical Flow metadata capture_

Intention is to allow users to drag and drop feeds and/or feed specifications into
waltz and automatically generate basic file header and related metadata.


## Survey Enhancements

_Recap of current functionality_

A `survey template` describes a set of questions. A `survey run` can then be created 
to generate `survey instances` that link a `survey target` (e.g. an application or 
change initiative) to a `survey participant`.

_Proposed enhancements_

 - Allow survey templates to be designed via the web interface
 - Enhance question types supported by the survey templates:
    - `application`: answer must be a application/s
    -  `person`: answer must be a person/s
    - `range`: answer must fall within a numeric range
    - `enum`: answer must be fall within a given set of options
 - Increase supported targets:
    - `measurable`: surveys can be issued against measurables
 - Increase variety of selectors which pick out the targets
 - Enhance cross linking of surveys
    - show all surveys relating to a user
    - link to entities which are mentioned in surveys 


## Perspective Visualisation

We need to be able to visualize relevant perspectives from within a measurable
view.   This could be as simple as drawing (potentially v. large) grid.


## Inter-measurable relationships

Implicit relationships can be seen via the related measurables section - this 
simply looks for measurables used by applications which also utilise the selected
measurable.  As such it is only a rough guide.  

Measurables should also support explicit links to other measurables to allow for 
quick navigation/exploration/filtering of related concepts. These relationships 
may be thought of similarly to traits - something that binds disparate elements. 
For example we may wish to relate Investment Banking as a business line to the 
product, processes or other measurables that it supports.
