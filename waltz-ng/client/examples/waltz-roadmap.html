                Basic support for defining instances of applications.
                Simple approach is to allow for an optional parent asset code.  This code can be used when
                joining to datasets to provide a complete view of an application (e.g. some servers may be
                registered to a parent code).

                with products having optional tags to indicate the type of tech (i.e. database, messaging, reporting).
                Each piece of technology may have an optional description and a flag to indicate if the technology
                is 'significant' (this will prevent long display lists of un-interesting technology).

                Libraries will be indexed in the same way, using the maven project co-ordinates (group, name, version)

            <strong>Technology Capability Model</strong>
            <p>
                Similar to the business capability model it may be desirable to have a separate technology
                capability model.  Applications will be able to declare which technology capabilities they
                perform along with a rating.  Currently the plan is to have a single rating per capability
                for the application, unlike the business capability's rating per perspective/measurable.

                Ability to record changes to rated capabilites against a predicted implementation date (year/quarter).
                Deltas can be associated to project initiatives or left as free standing changes.  Deltas can be
                projected onto the current view to see future state and they can also be browsed in with a detail
                oriented view.

            <strong>Capability Hierarchy</strong>
            <p>
                The capability model expresses a hierarchy, however the current implementation of the editor and
                perspective views do not reflect this hierarchy.

            <strong>Multiple Perspectives</strong>
            <p>
                Perspectives bundle a group of related measurables together.  An application can rate it's capabilities
                against these perspective-measurables.  Currently the data model supports multiple perspectives but the
                user interface does not allow for viewing or creating additional perspectives.

                Currently groups of applications are derived from aspects of the underlying model, namely
                Organisational Unit, Person and Capability.  Ad-hoc groups can be created by any user and may contain
                any number of applications.  Aggregate summary views (similar to the Organisational Unit view)
                will be provided.  To ease creation of groups we can utilise existing relationships in Waltz (i.e. add
                all applications which are downstream of a given starting application).

                By grouping capabilities and then analysing users with access to applications
                which perform those capabilities it is possible to determine if a given user
