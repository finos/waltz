# Report Grid Creation

Report grids display information about whatever apps or change initiatives their parent page includes.
In this example we are going to use starting point of a simple application group with two apps.
We will then build up an example report pulling in some assessments, organisational and other data points.  



## Open the Report Grid section

Report grids are accessible from any grouping page in Waltz and can be found on the left hand navigation menu.


| Step                                               | Image                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| First we need to open the "_Report Grids_" section | {{grid_section_opened.png}} |


## Create the basic grid

To create a grid we need to give it a name, optionally set a description and chose whether
the grid will display information about _Applications_ or _Change Initiatives_


| Step                                                                                                                  | Image                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Next, create a new grid using the "_Create a new report grid_" button                                                 | {{new_grid_form.png}}  |
| Fill in a title and description, in this example the report will be about Applications so we will leave that selected | {{completed_form.png}} |
| When we submit the form we will be taken to the column editor to customise the grid                                   | {{submitted_form.png}} |
